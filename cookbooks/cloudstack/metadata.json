  "long_description": "= DESCRIPTION:\n\nDownloads and unzips the CloudStack installation files, and provides tools for setting up a Single Node Management Server or installing the CloudStack agent on an infrastructure node.\n\nCurrently this cookbook is geared toward installing a single node (all in one) Management Server.  Later enhancements should include installation of the CloudStack agent and other Management Server configurations.\n\n= REQUIREMENTS:\n\nCurrently assumes that MySQL is already installed and configured.  This is intended to be used as additional recipes on a cloned version of the RightScale MySQL Database Manager - (http://www.rightscale.com/library/server_templates/Database-Manager-for-MySQL-5-1/31819) ServerTemplate.\n\n= ATTRIBUTES:\n\n* `node[:cloudstack][:package_url]` - The Download URL for the CloudStack package, defaults to \"http://sourceforge.net/projects/cloudstack/files/Cloudstack%202.2/2.2.13/CloudStack-2.2.13-1-rhel5.tar.gz\".\n* `node[:cloudstack][:install_dir]` - The directory where the CloudStack package will be uzipped\n\n= RECIPES:\n\n= USAGE:\n\n* Place cloudstack::install_cloudstack into your runlist to download and unzip the CloudStack installation files\n* Place cloudstack::setup_management_server into your runlist to configure the CloudStack Management Server in a single node configuration (Requires MySQL preinstalled per REQUIREMENTS above).\n\n== Single-Node Management Server\n* Include the following recipes in your runlist (or RightScale \"boot\" phase in ServerTemplate)\n  * db::default\n  * db_mysql::default\n  * db::install_client\n  * db::install_server\n  * db::setup_privileges_admin\n  * db::setup_privileges_application\n  * db::setup_monitoring\n  * openvpn::default\n  * cloudstack::setup_single_node_management_server\n* Make sure to set the following attributes\n  * cloudstack/csmanage/vpn/local = env:PRIVATE_IP\n* Fetch the OpenVPN Client configuration and keys thusly\n  * scp root@<ip of management server>:/etc/openvpn/keys/remote.tar.gz .\n* Connect your network to the management server OpenVPN server using the client config downloaded in the previous step\n* Complete configuration of your CloudStack managed private cloud by going to `http://<ip or hostname of instance>:8080/client`\n\n\n= TODO:\n\n* Create a recipe for setting up a management server in a multi node configuration\n* Create a recipe for installing the CloudStack agent\n* Self sign an SSL cert and protect the endpoint in single-node configuration\n\n= LICENSE AND AUTHOR:\n\nAuthor:: Ryan J.
